    the key if it is already plugged in.
 
 @discussion
    The session is not started automatically to allow a more granular approch on when the app should listen and interract
    with the key. When the app is requesting the user to use the key, the session needs to be started. When the app no longer
    requires the user to use the key, the session should be stopped. After calling this method the session will be opened
